An aerodynamics rotors course, with emphasis on Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines and propellers.
Rotor and wake aerodynamics are key to many applications such as helicopter and propeller rotors in transport and wind turbines. Rotors tend to generate three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamic phenomena that are complex both to understand and to model.
