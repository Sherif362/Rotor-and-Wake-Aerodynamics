An overview of aerodynamics of rotors, with emphasis on Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine rotors.
Rotor and wake aerodynamics are key to many applications such as helicopter and propeller rotors in transport and wind turbines. But rotors tend to generate three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamic phenomena that are complex both to understand and to model.
